 * turn settled and what its answer is; this file owns the TEAM policy on top of it:

 * question it cannot answer is FAILED `blocked` (D19), and the run registry the polling
 * verbs read. Rationale: ai-docs/architecture/team-lifecycle.md and team-capture.md.

 * No claudish timer ends a slot after its prompt was accepted (D10). The only bounds are
 * the pane's boot (90 s) and the admission of the prompt (30 s), before any work exists.

 * branch) with no translation, because Claude Code already speaks the Anthropic
 * wire format, and it authenticates with the user's own subscription rather
 * than an API key (claude-runner.ts deletes ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for these).
 *
 * These names used to be REJECTED here. That guard (91ee9a8) was written
 * because they "failed with cryptic model not found errors" — but the cause was
 * `internal`/`default` reaching Claude Code as literal model names, which it
 * does not recognise. That is fixed at the source now: the `--model` boundary
 * normalizes a selector to its tier (normalizeNativeModelSpec), and the child
 * runs. Rejecting here as well would block a slot that demonstrably works, and
 * would keep the internal reviewer outside `requirePattern` — the one guard
 * that catches a voter which never voted.
 *
 * Pinning is already safe: `isRoutablyPinnable` (prehydrate.ts) excludes
 * native-anthropic specs, so the name stays BARE and the proxy's `isNative`
 * test (no "/" and no "@") still matches it.
