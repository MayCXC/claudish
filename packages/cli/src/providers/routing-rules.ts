 *   2. Local config (./.claudish.json)
 *
 * Local overwrites global by exact key match — no glob-vs-glob interleaving.
 *
 * THERE ARE NO BUILT-IN RULES. The providers that can serve a bare name are
 * GATHERED from the cloud models catalog (`route-candidates.ts`), which
 * publishes every tier — subscriptions, native APIs and gateways — for every
 * model; a hand-written table merged under the user's rules could only
 * approximate that. So the result here is frequently `{}`, and `explainBareName`
 * treats "no rule matched" as "ask the catalog" rather than as an error.
 *
 * What a user rule now MEANS is therefore stronger than it was: a match is used
 * VERBATIM and is never merged with, reordered by or appended to by anything —
 * including the fallback hop. `routing["*"] = []` is consequently still the
 * strict no-route switch it always was, and `routing["*"] = [...]` replaces the
 * fallback outright.
 *
 * `sources` keeps rule composition testable without reading machine config.
 * The recommended-model projection is not a routing-rule override.
 *
 * Prints nothing. It runs inside the config TUI and the `--probe` TUI, where a
 * stray stderr line lands in the middle of a frame, and on every `route()` call.
 * Problems in the rules are {@link routingRuleProblems}'s to report: the proxy
 * prints them once at startup, and `explainRoute` returns them as warnings.

 *
 * That matters because Devin re-serves other vendors' models under uids that
 * legitimately contain dashes, `glm-5-2` and `glm-5-2-1m` among them (see
 * providers/devin/model-id-resolver.ts). Those are matched against Devin's LIVE
 * dynamic models catalog, so a `dv@glm-5-2` that ever became `dv@glm-5.2` would
 * request a uid that does not exist.
 *
 * No bare name can reach Devin through a COLLIDING family, which is what makes
 * the bare path safe to rewrite. Devin is a dynamic subscription, so it
 * publishes no catalog connection and can only be gathered from its namespace
 * claim — and that claim is exactly `/^swe-/i`, Cognition's own line. A bare
