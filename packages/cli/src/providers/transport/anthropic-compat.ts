   * SUBSCRIPTIONS (Alibaba Token Plan, Kimi Coding). The cloud /probeModels
   * catalog fundamentally cannot know which models a given key is entitled to
   * — that is a property of the caller's plan, not of the provider — so the
   * TUI falls back to GET /v1/probe-discover, which requires this method.
   * Without it the Test column reads "no probe model: transport does not
   * support discovery" for every subscription provider.
   *
   * Source of truth is the provider's own `modelDiscovery` descriptor (already
   * declared by qwen-token-plan and kimi-coding), reached through the shared
   * `discoverProviderModels()` — the same authenticated call the picker and
   * the context-window resolver use, so it shares their cache and their
   * credential-authority auth path. No new HTTP path is introduced here.
   *
   * Ordering: `rankDiscoveredModels()` (largest live context window first,
   * alphabetical tiebreak) — the same order the picker defaults to, so the
   * probe exercises the model the user would actually get.
   *
   * Non-chat rows are dropped by `discoverProviderProbeModel`, with the shared
   * `isReportedChatCapable()` filter the picker uses too, rather
   * than a per-provider skip list: qwen-token-plan's dynamic models catalog mixes
   * image/TTS models (`wan2.7-image`, `qwen-audio-3.0-tts-plus`) in with the text models, and
   * hardcoding model ids here would rot the moment Alibaba ships the next one.
