/**
 * `claudish daemon`: Claude Code's supervisor, run behind a claudish proxy.
 *
 * `claude daemon run` is the supervisor that hosts Claude Code's background
 * sessions, the ones agent view lists and attaches to
 * (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-view#the-supervisor-process). This
 * command starts a `--monitor` proxy on a fixed port and runs the supervisor as
 * its child, as the supervisor's service manager:
 *
 *   - The supervisor runs with `--origin service`. Only a `transient`
 *     supervisor, the kind a client starts on demand, exits once no client is
 *     attached; a service one stays up.
 *   - The supervisor is kept alive the way the unit `claude daemon install`
 *     writes for it keeps it (`Restart=always`, `RestartSec=1`,
 *     `StartLimitBurst=10` in `StartLimitIntervalSec=60`): every exit it takes
 *     on its own is followed by a start one second later, the upgrade exit (70,
 *     the supervisor's signal that its binary changed) through the reinstall
 *     wait below, and a supervisor started more than ten times within sixty
 *     seconds is given up on, ending this command with its code. The proxy
 *     stays up across every restart. A supervisor that lost `daemon.lock` to a
 *     transient one a client started into the gap of a restart exits 1; started
 *     again it finds the transient holding the lock, asks it to yield and takes
 *     its sessions over, Claude Code's own path for a service start, so the
 *     proxy, which every session depends on, never follows a race the
 *     supervisor settles by itself.
 *   - Ctrl-C, SIGTERM or SIGHUP stops the supervisor and its background
 *     sessions with `claude daemon stop --any` (a SIGTERM to the supervisor when
 *     that cannot run) and ends this command with 128 plus the signal's number.
 *     A signal of its own would stop the supervisor alone: its sessions detach
 *     for the next supervisor to adopt, and a session that outlives its machine
 *     leaves a liveness record that Claude Code, finding it from another pid
 *     namespace, takes for a live session.
 *
 * The origins, the exit code and the reinstall wait below are read from the
 * `claude daemon` code of Claude Code 2.1.281; its help documents `run` and the
 * on-demand default, not the origins.
 *
 * Sessions reach the proxy through the `env` block of a settings file, where
 * Claude Code's docs put a base URL for background sessions
 * (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-view#llm-gateway). The supervisor
 * builds a session's environment from its own, then removes each base URL
 * variable the dispatching client did not carry and keeps a carried one only
 * when it equals the supervisor's. The `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` given to the
 * supervisor here therefore reaches no session by itself: it is the value a
 * client's own must equal for Claude Code to forward it.
 *
 * With `--mcp-port`, this process also serves claudish's MCP tools over
 * Streamable HTTP (`startMcpHttpServer`), so every session, the supervisor's and a
 * terminal's alike, reaches one MCP server through a `"type": "http"` server
 * entry instead of starting its own `claudish --mcp`. It listens before the
 * supervisor starts, since a session connects to its MCP servers as it starts.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   claudish daemon --port <n> [--mcp-port <n>] [-- <claude daemon run options>]

Runs Claude Code's supervisor, \`claude daemon run --origin service\`, as the
child of a --monitor proxy on port <n>, so background sessions and agent view
can go through claudish. The supervisor is kept alive the way the unit
\`claude daemon install\` writes for it would: started again one second after
any exit, the upgrade exit included, and given up on, ending this command with
its code, after ten starts within a minute. Ctrl-C, SIGTERM or SIGHUP stops the
supervisor and its background sessions with \`claude daemon stop --any\` and
ends this command with 128 plus the signal's number.

Sessions reach the proxy only through a settings file's env block:
  "env": { "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:<n>" }
Add "_CLAUDE_CODE_ASSUME_FIRST_PARTY_BASE_URL": "1" to trust it as Anthropic's API.

With --mcp-port, claudish's MCP tools are served over HTTP as well, one server
for every session; declare it in place of \`claudish --mcp\`:
  "claudish": { "type": "http", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:<mcp-port>/mcp" }

Options:
  -p, --port <n>   Port for the proxy (required)
  --mcp-port <n>   Port for the MCP server
  -h, --help       Show this help
