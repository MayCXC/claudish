/**
 * prehydrate — resolve provider credentials in the PARENT before spawning
 * child `claudish` processes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The 1Password SDK's DesktopAuth handshake is arbitrated by the desktop app
 * across the whole MACHINE, not per process: it authorizes ONE client and
 * instantly denies every concurrent peer with
 *
 *   "Denied authorization for SDK client"
 *
 * claudish already serializes SDK calls WITHIN a process (`runSdkExclusive` in
 * op-source.ts — the -4 IPC fix), but `team` and channel `create_session` spawn
 * N sibling PROCESSES, and no in-process queue can span those. Each child
 * constructs its own SDK client and they all race.
 *
 * Measured on a 7-model `team` run (session team-20260729-163623): all seven
 * children spawned within 6ms, five hit the denial, and only the models whose
 * key happened to be in the shell env survived. Reduced repro: 6 children in a
 * tight loop → 5 denied; the same 6 staggered 4s apart → 0 denied.
 *
 * The denial is swallowed by `onAuthFailure: "skip"` (correct — a bad op source
 * must never lock the user out), so the child dies with a bare
 * "X API Key is required", which reads as "claudish ignored my 1Password setup".
 *
 * THE FIX
 *
 * Do in the parent, ONCE, what each child would otherwise do N times in
 * parallel. `validateApiKeysForModels` runs every model through the credential
 * authority, and the authority write-throughs each resolved op:// key into
 * `process.env` (api-key-credential.ts). Spawned children inherit `process.env`,
 * so they find the key in step 1 of the resolution chain and never construct an
 * SDK client at all — exactly the state the surviving models were already in.
 *
 * The parent's own resolution is serialized by the existing op queue, and a
 * 1Password Environment is fetched once per process (single-flight), so this
 * costs ONE handshake regardless of how many models are being spawned.
 *
 * Pre-hydration is the cheap path, not the whole fix. It covers the keys
 * 1Password CAN supply, at every spawn site claudish owns. Two other gaps are
 * handled elsewhere:
 *
 *   · Keys 1Password does NOT hold still send each child to the SDK →
 *     `publishOpSkipList` below tells children not to bother.
 *   · Two INDEPENDENT claudish processes launched at the same instant by
 *     unrelated sessions cannot be reached by any parent/child protocol →
 *     `providers/onepassword-handshake-lock.ts` serializes the handshake
 *     across processes.
 *
 * WHY HYDRATION ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH — the spawn PLAN
 *
 * Hydration resolves a CREDENTIAL. What it never resolved is the ROUTING
 * DECISION, and a bare model name is a chain, not a credential.
 * `validateApiKeysForModels` asks the authority about the ONE provider
 * `resolveModelProvider` picked and stops as soon as the answer is "available"
 * (`rescueRoutableResolutions` only runs on a "missing" verdict). The child,
 * handed that same bare name, re-walks the WHOLE chain and asks 1Password about
 * every candidate the parent short-circuited past — so it builds its own SDK
 * client after all. Measured: 17 channel children logged
 * "Denied authorization for SDK client" on runs where pre-hydration had already
 * succeeded (see baseline-evidence.md in this feature's session dir).
 *
 * So the parent now also RESOLVES THE ROUTE and returns a {@link SpawnPlan}
 * mapping each bare name to explicit `prefix@model` specs. A child launched with
 * explicit specs skips routing entirely and finds each provider's key in the
 * inherited env at step 1 of the resolution chain — `hasOpSources()` is never
 * reached, so no SDK client is ever built.
 *
 * The pin carries the WHOLE credential-filtered chain, joined by
 * `MODEL_CHAIN_SEPARATOR` (`zgo@m+mm@M+or@v/m`), not just the primary. Pinning
 * only the primary bought the one-dialog property at the cost of retryability:
 * `FallbackHandler` is built only for a name the child routes ITSELF, and
 * `isRetryableError` has no other caller, so a spawned child could not fall
 * through on a spent subscription, a rotated key, or a provider that rejects the
 * request shape — recoveries an interactive run makes for free. Every element of
 * the chain is still explicit, so nothing re-routes and the dialog property is
 * unchanged; the child just has somewhere to go when the first candidate fails.
 *
 * Handing over the chain is safe rather than merely hopeful because the keys for
 * ALL of it are already in `process.env` when the pin is made: `route()`'s bare
 * path calls `credentials.isAvailable()` on every candidate, and that resolution
 * write-throughs each op:// value into the env children inherit. Candidates that
 * failed the filter are absent from the chain, so the child never looks them up.
 *
 * ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING: phase A (hydrate) MUST complete before phase B
 * (route). `route()`'s credential filter reads the same env phase A writes;
 * run them the other way round and every candidate is a miss, so `route()`
 * itself re-enters the SDK for candidates hydration would have satisfied — the
 * same storm, relocated to the parent. That is the reason the pin lives in
 * here rather than at the two call sites.
 *
 * NOTHING SECRET GOES ON ARGV. The only thing added is a provider prefix; keys
 * still travel exclusively by inherited `process.env`. `team-orchestrator.ts`
 * persists the spawn command into `status.json`, and that string stays
 * secret-free under this design.
